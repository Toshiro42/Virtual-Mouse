# Virtual-Mouse
This project utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking to control the mouse cursor and system volume using hand gestures. The left hand is used for mouse functions such as movement and clicks, while the right hand adjusts the system volume by modifying the distance between the index finger and thumb.
